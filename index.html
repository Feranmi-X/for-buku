        I’m really sorry, babe. I’m making this out of the love I have for you,
        and I know you doubt it sometimes, but I truly do love you. I messed up,
        and you did too but if we truly want each other, we can put in the
        effort and make it work. I’m making this on 30/01/2026, and I just hope
        I finish on time. It’s 4:21 a.m. right now, and I’m doing the research
        to make this possible 😂 Show your friends too. My Buku, I’m sorry once
        again, and I mean everything this time. Let’s get this going for our
        kids. I know they will love you because you’re an amazing human being
        but you also have a lot to work on..<br />
        Please forgive me 🥺<br /><br />
        Also… will you be my
        <span class="font-bold text-pink-500">Valentine</span>? 😌
